# Factorial Calculator

A simple and interactive **Factorial Calculator** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS** (via **Tailwind CSS**), and **JavaScript**. The app calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using both **iterative** and **recursive** methods. It includes **dark/light mode** functionality and handles **input validation** to ensure only valid positive integers are accepted.

## Features:

- **Factorial Calculation**: Calculates factorial using both **iterative** and **recursive** methods.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for a better user experience.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the user enters only valid positive integers.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for mobile and desktop views, using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Modern UI**: Designed with a clean, intuitive user interface with smooth transitions and hover effects.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the factorial logic (both iterative and recursive methods).
- **Font Awesome**: For adding icons (used in the dark/light mode toggle button).
  
## How to Use:

1. **Enter a Positive Integer**: In the input field, enter a positive integer (e.g., `5`).
2. **Select Calculation Method**: Choose either **Iterative** or **Recursive** method to calculate the factorial.
3. **View Result**: The calculated factorial will be displayed below, along with the method used.
4. **Toggle Dark/Light Mode**: Use the button in the top-right corner to switch between dark and light modes for better visibility according to your preference.

## Running the Application Locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/factorial-calculator.git

	2.	Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd factorial-calculator


	3.	Open the index.html File: Open the index.html file in your browser to run the app.
